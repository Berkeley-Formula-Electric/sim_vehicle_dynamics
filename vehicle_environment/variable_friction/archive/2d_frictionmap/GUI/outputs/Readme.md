# Friction Map Data Dictionary
This repository contains the automatic generated frictionmodel datadict from the function "CreateDatadictGUI.m" for further operations in the simulation.
It also contains a configuration file which specifies the gridmaps used in the dictionary.
Both files are generated automatically.
